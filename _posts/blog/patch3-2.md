## Philosophy

After a full season of play in the Bingo League, Patch 3.1 successfully course corrected ourselves out of the original patch's heavy level shine focused meta. That being said, we still saw a lot of strength in level shines, but there at least was some counterplay available to players unable to outrace faster runners in the two main worlds that dominate in these strategies: Pianta and Ricco. Of special note is Pinna, who's availability at 10 shines and relatively large amount of goals focused on rewarding access to Pinna results in the level being stronger not necessarily on its own, but because of the strength of the worlds feeding into it.

The balance team set out with the vision of Patch 2.0's heavier focus on slower, non shine progression related goals, in an attempt to find the happy medium between 3.0 and 2.0's extremes. In that sense, this patch represents a further refinement more so than a titanic shift, which is further highlighted by the overall shorter changelist. As Sunshine Bingo continues to mature, the explorable space for new goals becomes smaller, and the focus of the balance team shifts to refinement and organizing to ensure the meta remains fresh and no one strategy becomes too strong. This is not to say that big changes may not happen in the future, but rather, that big changes every season should not be expected as the norm.

## New / Returning Goals

### 2 Secrets in 1 Level (List 17)

Levels with 2 secrets include Bianco, Pinna, and Sirena. While we expect to often see this done in Pinna, the counterplay possibilities of Bianco and Sirena make this an interesting goal overall, and one we want to experiment with.

### 15 Shines from Delfino w/ Blue Trades (List 21)

### 15 Blues from 3 Levels (List 24)

### 12 Blues from 4 Levels (List 24)

### 75 Blues (List 25)

We will discuss these changes in the Goal Pool Changes section.

## Goal Changes

### 9 Sirena Blues -> 8 Sirena Blues (List 6)

What good does removing one blue do? The idea is to make early Sirena blues a bit more interesting. Typically, players would have to compromise their Manta kill and their Sirena 2 entrance in order to complete this goal optimally. Now, while you could skip a single Noki, we expect the vast majority of players to pick whichever blue ends up being less convenient at the given time. While this won't change the meta drastically, we're interested in seeing if any new strategies emerge because of this small change.

### 8 Episodes -> 9 Episodes (List 22)

This change is designed to cut some power out of 1-7 episode rushes in Pianta and Ricco into quick single level shines like Gelato 1, especially when Pinna goals are valuable. The additional episode completion should add some counterplay to that strategy.

### Delfino Turbo Nozzle OR Sunglasses -> Delfino Turbo Nozzle (List 19)

Sunglasses, while a cute idea, were basically never done. Nor, in the broader context of matches played, were they ever a viable option. Reaching 30 shines without completing Pinna 1-4 is a very niche strategy that we feel does not represent how the goal ends up being played. While alternative options for secondary goals were discussed, no consensus was reached.

### 8 NPC Blue Coins OR Ricco 7 -> 9 NPC Blue Coins OR Ricco 8 (List 23)

This is, as should be very transparent, a Ricco and Pianta nerf. While we were not paid off by elements of the community demanding more Fire Pianta representation, the element of stopping a pure Pianta rush by forcing collection of the NPC in Pianta 3, or requiring some additional commitment post Pianta, adds additional avenues for counterplay. This also doesn't over compromise other routes for NPCs, requiring access to some deeper levels in addition, but nothing too major that routes to obtain Piantaless 8 NPCs weren't already doing. Ricco 7 was evaluated to be too early when compared to 9 NPCs, so it also gets pushed back to it's original Ricco 8. We'll be keeping an eye on this change, as the viability of being able to choose either / or of Pianta and Ricco is valuable to keep around.

### 5 Shines from 2 Levels -> 4 Shines from 2 Levels (List 7)

### 4 Shines from 3 Levels -> 5 Shines from 3 Levels (List 21)

The 5th shine in many worlds presents difficulty. Whether it's valueless, slow, or just plain annoying, 5 from 2 was a goal that wished it was a true early game goal, but ended up forcing people into the least painful paths to completion. By contrast, 4 from 3 ended up being easier to obtain due to the relative speed of those first 4 shines in most levels. The primary goal with changing to 4 from 2 is to enable Bianco to be more viable as an option for that goal, and 5 from 3 is designed to allow for more routing possibilities in the late game to close things out.

## Goal Pool Changes

### Preface

Unlike patch 3.1, there are fewer moves overall, but these moves are still important as they allow us to subtly change how goals interact with each other on the card. Knowing where and how goals spawn on a card is critical to success.

### Pools 7, 12, and 17

| Pool Number | Old Goals                                                                                                                                                                                                               | New Goals                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 7           | { name: "Complete a Boss Rematch"},<br>{ name: "6 Ricco Shines"},<br>{ name: "2 Hidden Shines from 1 Level (NO Gelato)"},<br>**{ name: "6 Hidden Shines"},**<br>{ name: "7 Shines in Secrets"}                          | { name: "Complete a Boss Rematch"},<br>{ name: "6 Ricco Shines"},<br>{ name: "2 Hidden Shines from 1 Level (NO Gelato)"},<br>{ name: "7 Shines in Secrets"},<br>**{ name: "4 Shines from 2 Levels"},**<br>**{ name: "4 Hidden Shines"}** |
| 12          | { name: "1 Pinna Hidden Shine "},<br>{ name: "7 Pinna Beach Blue Coins OR 4 Fruit Lady Blue Coins"},<br>{ name: "20 Blue Coins from 2 Levels"},<br>**{ name: "4 Hidden Shines"},**<br>{ name: "10 Yellow Button Coins"} | { name: "1 Pinna Hidden Shine "},<br>{ name: "7 Pinna Beach Blue Coins OR 4 Fruit Lady Blue Coins"},<br>{ name: "20 Blue Coins from 2 Levels"},<br>**{ name: "5 Hidden Shines"},**<br>{ name: "10 Yellow Button Coins"}                  |
| 17          | { name: "5 Secret Shines"},<br>**{ name: "5 Shines from 2 Levels"},**<br>{ name: "Bianco Shadow Mario"},<br>**{ name: "5 Hidden Shines"},**<br>{ name: "4 Noki Shines"}                                                 | { name: "5 Secret Shines"},<br>**{ name: "2 Secrets in 1 Level"},**<br>{ name: "Bianco Shadow Mario"},<br>**{ name: "6 Hidden Shines"},**<br>{ name: "4 Noki Shines"}                                                                    |

The goal here with these changes is to shuffle around how goals should interact with each other when we add in the new and modified goals, as well as consolidate some of the pools together. We end up with a a pool 7 that contains Ricco focused goals that are counterable in Bianco, a pool 12 acting as Pinna containment, and a pool 17 that focuses on deep progression in slower levels.

### Pools 2 and 3

| Pool Number | Old Goals                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | New Goals                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2           | **{ name: "Two 100 Coin Shines"},**<br>{ name: "50 Yellow Coins from 2 Levels OR 150 Delfino Yellow Coins"},<br>{ name: "1 Bianco Hidden Shine"},<br>{ name: "1 Turbo Nozzle Unlock"},<br>{ name: "Pianta 100 Coin Shine"} | **{ name: "15 Gelato Blue Coins"},**<br>{ name: "50 Yellow Coins from 2 Levels OR 150 Delfino Yellow Coins"},<br>{ name: "1 Bianco Hidden Shine"},<br>{ name: "1 Turbo Nozzle Unlock"},<br>{ name: "Pianta 100 Coin Shine"} |
| 3           | { name: "18 Lives"},<br>{ name: "22 Lives"},<br>{ name: "Ricco 100 Coin Shine"},<br>{ name: "Gelato 100 Coin Shine"},<br>**{ name: "15 Gelato Blue Coins"}**                                                               | { name: "18 Lives"},<br>{ name: "22 Lives"},<br>{ name: "Ricco 100 Coin Shine"},<br>{ name: "Gelato 100 Coin Shine"},<br>**{ name: "Two 100 Coin Shines"},**                                                                |

This shuffle had one singular goal: To allow 50 Yellows from 2 Levels and 2 100 Coin Shines to spawn on the same card. 50 from 2 was already a weak goal option, so we're interested in seeing the implications of allowing them to show up together. It's a direct way to buff 100s without adding strange "nothing" goals to try to increase the power.

### Pools 21, 24, and 25

| Pool Number | Old Goals                                                                                                                                                                                                     | New Goals                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 21          | { name: "3 Shines from 4 Levels"},<br>{ name: "4 Shines from 3 Levels"},<br>{ name: "2 Turbo Nozzle Unlocks"},<br>{ name: "13 Shines from Delfino (With Blue Trades)"},<br>**{ name: "80 Total Blue Coins"}** | { name: "3 Shines from 4 Levels"},<br>{ name: "5 Shines from 3 Levels"},<br>{ name: "2 Turbo Nozzle Unlocks"},<br>{ name: "13 Shines from Delfino (With Blue Trades)"},<br>**{ name: "15 Delfino Shines w/ Blue Trades"}** |
| 24          | { name: "40 Total Blue Coins"},<br>{ name: "45 Total Blue Coins"},<br>{ name: "50 Total Blue Coins"}                                                                                                          | **{ name: "15 Blue Coins from 3 Levels"},**<br>**{ name: "12 Blue Coins from 4 Levels"},**<br>{ name: "40 Total Blue Coins"},<br>{ name: "45 Total Blue Coins"},<br>{ name: "50 Total Blue Coins"}                         |
| 25          | { name: "60 Total Blue Coins"},<br>{ name: "65 Total Blue Coins"},<br>{ name: "70 Total Blue Coins"}                                                                                                          | { name: "60 Total Blue Coins"},<br>{ name: "65 Total Blue Coins"},<br>{ name: "70 Total Blue Coins"},<br>**{ name: "75 Total Blue Coins"},**<br>**{ name: "80 Total Blue Coins"}**                                         |

This is (arguably) the biggest change in this patch. This is the first time that pools 24 and 25 are seeing major changes. At first glance, this doesn't seem too significant, but there's some interesting implications. First of all, the additions of the new 15 from 3 and 12 from 4 goals are designed to add some variety to the lower total blue count goals, increasing the cards where early blues plays can be relevant. Second of all, consolidating 80 totals and adding 75 totals increases the likelihood of there being a deep blues goal. Finally, returning 15 Delfinos w/ Blue Trades helps to keep blues power level in terms of number of goals per card consistent, while rewarding another blues commitment goal in a way that isn't just a higher totals. Overall, we're satisfied with where blues are after these changes, but may be looking to buff them further if they still remain weak compared to level shines.

## Grammar Changes

### Lily pad NO Pipe Clipping -> Lily Pad NO Pipe Clipping

The subject of heated debate amongst the balance team. On the one side, referring to the Wikipedia page for [Nymphaeaceae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nymphaeaceae) reveals that the "correct" spelling and presentation of the oblong shape sometimes called [Seeblatt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seeblatt) is 'Lily Pad'. In addition, citing the Offical Nintendo Player's Guide for Super Mario Sunshine, the shine is called ["Lily Pad Ride"](https://www.mariowiki.com/Lily_Pad_Ride) (Though, the italian version and the Prima guide refer to it as "Pipe Down #3"). However, looking at both the [IL spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12wDUXjLqmcUuWSEXWc1fHNJc24KlfyCh0pvibZYEQM0/edit#gid=903730331&range=DX2:DX3) and words used in the [Sunshine Discord](https://i.imgur.com/5YdbyGF.png) imply community consensus is around "Lilypad". Regardless, in an attempt to remain "grammatically correct", we will be preserving the space, but fixing the capitalization. In an effort to also write more words for this change than any other change in these patch notes for comedic effect, did you know that Nymphaeaceae are actually herbs? The balance team is unsure about their culinary applications, but we encourage the community to discover some. Or, perhaps instead, you wish to evoke [Claude Monet](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Lilies_(Monet_series)>) and create an oil painting of "Pipe Down #3"? Regardless of what you choose, we hope that you make yourself heard about #LilyPadGate in our [discord](https://sms.bingo/discord) and on [twitter](https://twitter.com/smscommunity).

## Final Notes

As always, we invite your feedback in our [discord](https://sms.bingo/discord). The upcoming mini tournament on March 5th and Bingo League Season 4 will be played on the 3.2 patch, unless other changes occur. Thank you for reading, and happy bingoing!

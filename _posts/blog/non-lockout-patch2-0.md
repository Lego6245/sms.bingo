A new patch is out for Super Mario Sunshine Non-Lockout, and per usual we will be documenting and explaining the changes here. It is quite drastic from the old patch, and this is based off of Juan’s non-lockout patch he made a few months back, so not every change will likely be covered, but most will be.

There are also quite a bit of name changes to both fit in line with 1v1 Lockout’s style and also cut down on the jank, so to speak. Not all will be listed here.

## New Goals

### 50 Yellow Coins from 3 Levels

We experimented with this goal in 1v1 recently where we found it was too much of a commitment, but for non-lockout we think this fits much better.

### Box Game 3

This goal is returning from the 2v2 2021 Tourney. It was pretty well liked there, and while it's quite easy here, we think it’ll be a nice addition as one of the more “free” goals.

### 150 Coins from Delfino

This is a returning goal from 1v1 Lockout, that helps make a delfino play a little bit stronger if it comes up, as you can route shines between it.

### 7 NPCs (No Pianta)

Pianta previously made the NPCS goal quite free, as players would go to Episode 6 to achieve it- so this presents new routing decisions and potentially a deeper Sirena buff as well.

### 15 Blues from 3 Worlds

This will likely be in contention for 1v1 as well based off our feedback from Season 4, but for the purposes of non-lockout we thought it was 100% a winner, also providing a slight buff to a fruit ladies play.

### 20 Blues from 2 Levels

A carry over from 1v1.

### 12 Blues from 5 Worlds

None (Editors Note: While not on the balance team, this change seems to be similar to 1v1's philosophy as well, adding variety to blues goals while encouraging broader play. 12 from 5 will be interesting in non-lockout, as some cards really reward finding the shallow yet broad line which this goal synergizes with.)

### 5 Enemy Blue Coins (No Ricco)

This is another carry over from the 2v2 Tournament. This can serve as either a deep Gelato buff, but also makes the “Bees” play more of a reality too.

### 6 Buttons in Unique Locations

This is an experimental goal we are trying out this patch, and are unsure how it will play out currently. This can include any of the Yellow Buttons and Red Coin Buttons, and the Red Coin Buttons do not need to be finished to achieve the goal.

### 4 Nozzle Unlocks

This is a carry-over from 2v2 that is a bit more interesting than the days of 2 Rocket Nozzles.

### 10 NPC Blues

We here at Sunshine Bingo Airlines hope you enjoy your stay in Pianta Village.

### 12 Delfino Shines (With Blue Trades)

Carried over from 1v1, can boost a Delfino play if you are also planning to get blues with it.

### Enter 10 Pipes and Collect Their Shines

Based off the pipes goals in 1v1, meant to buff Pianta, Sirena, and/or a Delfino play.

### Lighthouse Shine

A carry over from 1v1, this can be done with Yoshi if one wishes to practice that trick, or with the Delfino Rocket if you are planning for 30 Shines in your route. You can also do infinite wall kicks and if you are good at that insane trick, it can pay off huge in terms of a timesave.

### 3 Turbo Nozzles

There are 5 in the game, so we think that 3 Turbo Nozzles will be achievable, but we are yet to see how this will play out in actual matches.

## Goal Changes

### 10 M Graffitis -> 15 M Grafittis

### 20 M Graffitis -> 22 M Graffitis

10 M Graffitis was simply too convenient - 15 is still easy, but requires at the very least visiting more than 2 worlds to achieve. 22 is also hard, but with a pool of 27 accessible M’s (3 more if you go deep Sirena), this goal being meatier will encourage a world tour play.

### 10 Delfino Blues -> 12 Delfino Blues

This change both fits in line with lockout a little better and requires a bit more leg work to achieve.

### 6 Blue Birds -> 5 Blue Birds

5 Blue Birds gives the routing potential for deep Bianco and deep Pianta, whereas 6 requires a visit to Pinna. Also fits in line with lockout.

### 10 Noki Blues -> 12 Noki Blues

Fits more in line with 1v1 Lockout, similar change to the Delfino Blues change.

### Ride Yoshi in Pinna -> Ride Yoshi in 2 Levels

Ride Yoshi in Pinna WAS way too free, this will provide another element of routing and planning. Ride Yoshi in 3 Levels is also a goal in a deeper pool.

### 8 Delfino Shines -> 6 Delfino Shines

### 10/11 Delfino Shines -> Removed

Delfinos are typically weak in non-lockouts because of the heavy amount of them, especially in Triples. Lowering this to 6 makes the play a bit more tolerable and easy to route in, also makes a reds/pipes play a bit more appealing too.

### 2 Episode 8 Shines -> 8 Shines from 2 Levels

2 Episode 8 Shines is much harder to achieve and more strict in what shines you do, we hope the possibility of doing hiddens and 100’s will make this goal less daunting.

## Other Changes

### Pool Updates: Lives

Previously, it was possible to get 3 Lives goals on a card. Now, there is a maximum possibility of two, being either “20 or 25”, or “30, 35, or 40”, or both.

### Pool Updates: Blues

This was changed to be more in line with lockout, previously you could get goals very close together such as 30 and 35 on the same card, with the potential for more total goals too. Now there are only two possible total goals on the same card, with some new total goals listed below.

## Conclusion

These changes will be live on Bingothon's Bingosync instance. Happy Non-Lockouting!

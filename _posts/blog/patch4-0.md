## Philosophy

4.0 represents a big leap in terms of goal type and uniqueness to add variety and challenge to play. While 3.2 was in a "good state" during Season 4, we wanted to branch out and try new and different goal types in the hopes of creating more gameplay oppertunity and interesting decision points during matches. We would like to note we are heavily keeping an eye on matches and scrims and the possibility of making a “4.1” if needed, as we did for 3.0, but as of right now we have no reason to believe that this will be necessary.

## New Concepts

For the first time in a while, there is a new goal type (and a returning goal type) being added to the format.

### Mini-Boss Shines

Shines that count as a “Mini-Boss” are: **Bianco 1, Gelato 2, Pianta 1, Pianta 4, Pinna 4, and Pinna 5**. We wanted to provide a goal that provides synergy between Pianta and other worlds, something that is quite difficult as Pianta is a void-world. All of these episodes involve creatures that spawn shines, which was the criteria for inclusion. Notibly absent is Airstrip, which is ignored due to it being a required shine.

### Jumpless

Previously in the format and removed due to complexity, the meta has evolved such that inclusion of jumpless goals can help provide some much needed "challenge" style shine representation. "Jumpless" uses the Super Mario Oddyssey definition, banning specifically the pressing of the "A" button while standing or running to give Mario vertical height. This includes regular jumps, double and triple jumps, spinjumps, sideflips, and backflips. Use of the hover nozzle, wall kicks, glitchy wall kicks, and roll-outs are acceptable.

## New / Returning Goals

### Pinna 3 Hoverless (Pool 12)

In Patch 4.0 we aimed to have a few goals that test gameplay skills too, as routing and the meta has started to become a bit more solved and predictable, leading to a natural buff in “challenges” to make things a bit more interesting, which welcomes back this goal to the format. It provides an interesting break in skipping doing the shine hoverless to get ahead in Pinna, or trusting that both your lead and gameplay will be enough for the goal. A beginner tutorial can be found [here](https://youtu.be/bxbXXPK1IWY).

### 4 Mini-Boss Shines (Pool 8)

We considered two main routes to achieve this goal.

-   Pianta 1-4 -> Pinna 4,5: This is the classic “Pianta into Pinna” play. However, this goal does have counterplay with the below:
-   Pianta 1-4 -> Bianco 1, Gelato 2: This should be faster than the above play, and with cards where Gelato is strong, is not unreasonable to consider.

As this is the first new “category” goal we’ve had in a long time, we are keeping a close eye on this one. Our rationale for 4 and not 3 as hinted at before, is that 3 favors speedier players too heavily without the oppertunity for a slower player to work around it.

### 100 Coin Shine in an Episode 2 (Pool 15)

We hope this can provide a small buff to 100’s and a potential counterplay between Ricco 2 100’s and Pinna 2 100’s. It should be noted that while you can do Ricco 2 100’s very early, this would put you behind to quite a bit of early game goals, so we do not view this as a problem, or at least not any more of a problem than “100’s in a Boss Shine” and Ricco 100’s would provide (to note, both boss 100s and this goal live in the same pool, so they cannot spawn together on the same card). Gelato 2 100’s is also doable, which can work very well if Gelato 100’s is on the card, and Noki 2 100’s is a possibility if it’s up that long. The true patrician choice is Bianco 2 100s, though we do not anticipate it being done.

### Noki 2 Jumpless (Pool 18)

This provides more "jumpless" goals to the pool, and Noki’s first “challenge” shine- as almost every world has one (Such as Bianco 4 Hoverless and Pianta 3 Damageless). A beginner tutorial can be found [here](https://youtu.be/jgvXfQoDKuU), and a more advanced tutorial can be found [here](https://youtu.be/waeYDadZslg)

### Sirena 5 OR Noki 6 OR Gelato 6 (Pool 23)

King Boo has been freed, alongside the rarely done secret in Noki and the red coins of Gelato. This provides deep exploration of worlds we do not typically see explored. In a bingo, it is not uncommon for one of these objectives to be one or two shines away from being a possibility, so this will typically be additional incentive to make a deep play to win the match.

## Goal Changes

### 22 Lives -> 25 Lives (Pool 3)

In patch 3.1, we updated the goal to 22 Lives, and now we update it again to 25. There needed to be a bigger gap between it and it's sister goal 18 Lives in order for the increase in life grinding or routing to be meaningful. This is also a small buff to having Sirena 2 or Pianta 5 completed.

### 15 Blues from 3 Levels -> 15 Blues from 3 Worlds (Pool 24)

A commonly requested buff, and one that's worth giving due to the nature of 15 Delfino Blues being a hard time commitment, allowing them to spawn together and synergize.

## Pool Changes

### Pools 17 and 19

| Pool Number | Old Goals                                                                                                                                                             | New Goals                                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 17          | { name: "5 Secret Shines"},<br>{ name: "2 Secrets in 1 Level"},<br>**{ name: "Bianco Shadow Mario"}**,<br>{ name: "6 Hidden Shines"},<br>{ name: "4 Noki Shines"}     | { name: "5 Secret Shines"},<br>{ name: "2 Secrets in 1 Level"},<br>**{ name: "Noki 100 Coin Shine"}**,<br>{ name: "6 Hidden Shines"},<br>{ name: "4 Noki Shines"}     |
| 19          | { name: "6 Red Coin Shines"},<br>**{ name: "Noki 100 Coin Shine"}**,<br>{ name: "Delfino Turbo Nozzle"},<br>{ name: "Delfino Rocket Nozzle"},<br>{ name: "26 Shines"} | { name: "6 Red Coin Shines"},<br>**{ name: "Bianco Shadow Mario"}**,<br>{ name: "Delfino Turbo Nozzle"},<br>{ name: "Delfino Rocket Nozzle"},<br>{ name: "26 Shines"} |

The goal is to buff deeper Bianco by allowing more synergy of spawning with goals like 2 Secrets 1 Level and 5 Secret Shines. Additionally, this allows for us to maintain a roughly equivilent amount of Noki goals per card by consoldiating Noki 100s with 4 from Noki.

### Pools 24 and 25

| Pool Number | Old Goals                                                                                                                                                                                      | New Goals                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 24          | { name: "15 Blue Coins from 3 Worlds"},<br>**{ name: "12 Blue Coins from 4 Levels"}**,<br>{ name: "40 Total Blue Coins"},<br>{ name: "45 Total Blue Coins"},<br>{ name: "50 Total Blue Coins"} | { name: "15 Blue Coins from 3 Worlds"},<br> { name: "40 Total Blue Coins"},<br>{ name: "45 Total Blue Coins"},<br>{ name: "50 Total Blue Coins"}                                       |
| 25          | { name: "60 Total Blue Coins"},<br>{ name: "65 Total Blue Coins"},<br>{ name: "70 Total Blue Coins"},<br>{ name: "80 Total Blue Coins"}                                                        | **{ name: "12 Blue Coins from 4 Levels"}**,<br>{ name: "60 Total Blue Coins"},<br>{ name: "65 Total Blue Coins"},<br>{ name: "70 Total Blue Coins"},<br>{ name: "80 Total Blue Coins"} |

One of the misses in Patch 3.2 was the length of 12 Blue Coins from 4 Levels. Commonly, this would be one of the last goals obtained in a match, and would be done with many more total blues collected than the anticipated amount during initial planning. It's home in Pool 25 will allow for it to frolic amongst the longer total blues goals as nature intended.

## Final Notes
